I used the Github Page template forked from [Academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages), which is extremely helpful in building an academic website. The original template was forked by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
