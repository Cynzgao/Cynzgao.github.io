## About 
My name is Zehui Cynthia Gao and I am an incoming MS student at Columbia University. 

I graduated from Columbia with a BS in Applied Math in May, 2020 and received a BA from Bard College at Simon's Rock as well. 

This website is a place where I can share my progress in studying Math & CS and other non-academic interests.
